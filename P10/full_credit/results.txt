QUESTION 1: Which value of slices did you select for your machine to solve the polynomial with 1 thread with at least a 30 second runtime: 
-


QUESTION 2: Provide the output of ``time polyb nn`` (or the improved version in the lecture video, if you prefer) for the following values of nn threads shown below:

Example Timing:

real	0m22.551s
user	0m22.524s
sys	0m0.012s


YOUR Timing:

Without threads:
real	0m5.420s
user	0m4.617s
sys	0m0.681s

With 2 threads:
real	0m0.200s
user	0m0.169s
sys	0m0.022s

With 4 threads:
real	0m0.200s
user	0m0.169s
sys	0m0.022s

With 6 threads:
real	0m0.158s
user	0m0.121s
sys	0m0.034s

With 8 threads:
real	0m0.219s
user	0m0.200s
sys	0m0.014s

With 12 threads:
real	0m0.267s
user	0m0.224s
sys	0m0.038s


With 24 threads:
real	0m0.216s
user	0m0.188s
sys	0m0.024s

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?
-More thread supposed to speed up the program but the result is similar using all thread. 



QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
-Adding new threads increase the system load as two core will be working paralley in the system.
